    <h3>Here are my projects:</h3>
    <i><B style="font-size: larger; color:aqua">1. Drivers Drowsiness
    Detection System:</B></i> Arduino-based Driver Drowsiness Detection System monitors a driver’s eye movements using an infrared eye blink sensor or a webcam. When signs of drowsiness are detected (such as prolonged eye closure), the system triggers alerts—such as a loud buzzer or visual warnings—to keep the driver awake and prevent accidents.

    <i><B style="font-size: larger; color:aqua">2. Smart Blind Stick:</B></i> The Smart Blind Stick is an innovative project designed to enhance mobility for visually impaired individuals. By combining Arduino and sensors, this smart stick offers several features. An ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in the user’s path, measuring distances and providing real-time feedback to help avoid collisions. Additionally, a light-dependent resistor (LDR) adapts to varying lighting conditions, ensuring optimal visibility whether indoors or outdoors.

    <i><B style="font-size: larger; color:aqua">3. Weather Station:</B></i> I created an Arduino-based weather monitoring system that collects data on temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Using sensors, I measure these parameters and display them on an LCD screen. Additionally, I set up a Wi-Fi module to send real-time updates to a web server. It’s a fun project that combines electronics, programming, and data visualization!

   <i><B style="font-size: larger; color:aqua">4. Arduino Based Radar:</B></i> The Arduino-based radar system is an exciting project that allows you to detect stationary and moving objects within a short range. By combining an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino board, and creative software development, you can visualize the presence of objects around you.

    <i><B style="font-size: larger; color:aqua">5. Solar Tracking System:</B></i> The Solar Tracking System is an ingenious project that optimizes solar panel efficiency by dynamically adjusting their orientation to follow the sun’s path throughout the day. By using light sensors and motors, this system ensures that solar panels capture maximum sunlight, enhancing energy production.
